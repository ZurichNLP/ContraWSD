The act had just finished when he came in, so before going to his brother's box he went up to the front row and paused beside Serpukhovskoy, who was standing with his knee bent, tapping the wall of the orchestra with his heel. He had noticed Vronsky afar off and welcomed him with a smile.
Footwear with outer soles of hempen rope, 57% of the surface of which is reinforced with rubber at the toe, ball and heel, must be classified as footwear with outer soles of rubber falling within heading No 64.02 of the Common Customs Tariffand, having regard to the material of which the uppers are made, under letter Β of that heading.
Moreover, the fact that the textile material is exposed underneath the leather and at the heel does not mean that it cannot be described as lining.
Third, the presence of exposed textile material around the leather and at the heel appears to be intended to make the shoe more comfortable to wear.

Finally, the third paragraph states that the Commission shall ensure the application of the provisions of this article.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is stated in this fourth paragraph:
The basis for this stipulation is a clause in the Solemn Declaration of the Stuttgart European Council of June 1983 (point 2.3.7, final paragraph):
REMARKS Add the following paragraph at the end of the remarks:
But there is a third paragraph: of the Group of
What does this third paragraph mean ?
The last paragraph of the amendment recommends that work should be carried out mainly under research contracts and partly by the Commission's Biology Group at the Ispra Establishment of the Joint Research Centre.
I request a separate vote, Mr President, on the first paragraph and the rest of the amendment.
Rule 14 (3), (4), (5) and (6) Replace these paragraphs with the following single paragraph:
Modify the remarks by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph mentions hot showers during working time.
In the justification, on page 8 in the very last paragraph, it says:
Therefore, either a single amendment replaces the whole text - and that has been the procedure so far - or each paragraph is put to the vote separately.
However, it will amend this paragraph to make it clear that tariffs must cover the direct operating costs of the carrier on the route in question and that State aids granted in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty may be deducted from the carrier's costs.
I wonder if the Commissioner would kindly confirm to us that it is the Commission's intention to make the study referred to in the second paragraph.
That is why I am also asking everyone to pay close attention to the last paragraph in the motion for a resolution where we advocate the idea of a joint study by the Committees on Agriculture and Development of all the new aspects which are being introduced into the sugar sector by new techniques and products.
The last paragraph of Article 3 merely restates that the Commission has the right of initiative, according to the Treaties.
In this agreement, there was a paragraph stating that the Council of Ministers would agree upon measures to fulfil the 1984 and 1985 'gap'.
As regards respect for human rights within the Community, the Council points out that in ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Communities, the Member States approved the paragraph in the preamble which states:
It pays much too much attention to a Senate subcommittee which has actually no power and too little to developing the theme in the other paragraph.
The phrase 'by the European Parliament' has been omitted in the French version, and this renders the paragraph meaningless, although it had been the sub ject of a very long discussion in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
One paragraph of the resolution tabled by Mr Her man and his friends does in contrast merit comment by us for we are amazed that the Commission proposals have been denounced as being only short-term.
We were doing Rule 102 (a), we voted on the first paragraph but to my recollection we did not actually vote on the second paragraph.
Clearly the Assembly has adopted the first paragraph.
A majority on the committee then voted this paragraph down.
An amendment tabled by me and supported by the majority of the Assembly appears in the Minutes as rejected and, finally, recital B of the original resolution has been magically converted into the first paragraph of the main text.
In the last paragraph of Section III concerning the Committee on Budgets we again have a mistranslation. It should read 'im Bereich der Haushaltsordnung', not 'im Bereich der Finanzverordnung'.
That paragraph fails to take into account the fact that the Baltic countries are at present part of the Soviet Federation, as their authorities and peoples are fully aware, just as they know that the pace of the reforms depends on that of democratization in the Soviet Union.
We are referring here to Article 14, second paragraph.
But if we analyse that article we see in the first paragraph that 'Member States shall pay particular attention to encouraging improvements especially in the working environment'.
Owing to a misunderstanding in my group sixteen Members voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
I understand that it would not have made any difference to the final result since the paragraph was lost by 55 votes.
Can the Commission confirm whether it has drawn up a report on the implementation, in accordance with paragraph B, of Recommendation 85/308/EEC!on social protection fot volunteer development workers ? Furthermore, does this recommendation apply to the Community's newest entrants?
You undoubtedly know that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty, in the current version, says: 'The Council shall consist of representatives of the Member States.
First, will the Commission accept this amendment to delete the second paragraph of Article 6 ?
Each paragraph refers to the Kurds, the Cyprus problem, torture, free press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, which means there are problems.
Secondly, it is the case that the Maastricht Treaty says in the first paragraph of Article J 4: "The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence."
So I hope the Commissioner might actually consult his colleagues over Christmas and invite them to pre-empt my paragraph in the resolution in the New Year.
Yet this week in the European Parliament began well, we discussed among other things the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summed up the views of many Members of Parliament.
And that was what that paragraph said.
However, when one looks at part II of the Minutes, the first item is actually a decision consisting of three recitals and one operative paragraph.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 25% to reach 12.7 million units.
Repeatedly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.

ORIGIN: the idea of tariff preferences was prompted by the realization of the difficulties encountered by countries with nascent industries, i.e., the developing countries, in gaining access to and expanding sales of their products on the markets of the industrialized countries.
Such a market structure is conducive to internationalisation, as national oligopolies with stable domestic markets look elsewhere in order to expand sales.
Price Reductions for Exceeding Agreed-Upon Unit Sales: France has forced price reductions of products whose sales volume significantly exceeded the unit sales submitted in the original price application.
Such uniform EEC standards would give the European motor vehicle industry an important competitive advantage over lorry manufacturers outside the Community, since 57 states are meanwhile adopting EEC standards in their national legislation, because they have recognized that these would be useful and workable in their countries too; this encourages lorry sales and at the same time creates thousands of new jobs within the Community, jobs which we urgently need, Mr Collins.
I think it important to make the point that all parts of the European car industry achieved record sales in the years up to the beginning of 1980, and that the increasing competition from Japan had been forseeable for a long time by all of us, including the European car industry, whose managers perhaps thought that things would continue to go as well as they had in the past without any special efforts on their part.
It will intensify competition within Europe, because even those Member States which have so far tried to protect themselves by introducing restrictions on their Japanese competitors will very soon realize that European car-makers will try to make inroads into these countries' markets so as to keep up their sales levels in the face of the increased flow of Japanese imports.
Against the background of increasing milk production in the Community in 1982 and the attendant increase in butter production, the Commission considers that in the short term there is a need for two types of measures, the first to ensure reasonable sales of butter stocks, and the second to prevent excessive stocks forming again.
As you know, the Community has dropped behind considerably over the past ten years; its sales, already mediocre, show this.
Both the technical barrier subcommittee and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs itself consider that the noise level of household machines was a competitive sales point and that market forces would take care of the problem and remove any necessity for legislation.
Both Community consumer organizations and the Socialist group have tirelessly pointed out that nothing less than the removal of sales and price guarantees and an orientation towards real structural policy can get the muddled vehicle back on the right track again.
This kind of operation would have enabled Rumania to increase artificially its sales on the world market during 1985, which would have been bound to aggravate the already difficult situation on the butter market.

Contrary to the hopes of all, including Norway's expressed expectations, sales to the Japanese market did not increase during 1995 but in fact were slightly lower.
Moreover, by operating a prudent export policy, the Commission encourages sales of Community rice in the internal market.
However, I think that the various views of the Member States on the promotion of sales in the internal market and the overall stance of the Member States on the sale or promotion of sales of alcoholic drinks would make it difficult to include this in the - common organisation of the market in wine.
The present initiative is particularly timely as the results of the campaign to promote olive oil and fibre flax, to which, Mr Fantuzzi also referred, are already available. Sales of these products outside the Community have increased thanks to ad hoc methods of promotion.
In this context, I should like to say that what emerges from Mr Fantuzzi's report about endeavouring to increase sales is constructive.
The EU must pursue an active export policy that goes beyond the use of export refunds and can have a positive impact on the sales of agricultural products over and above the existing export refunds.
Within the Community, sales of starch and its derivatives are promoted by means of production subsidies when such products are used in the sectors of industry which have no protection from imports, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and the paper industry.

- facilitate sales on the world market of the quantities of agricultural products not covered by the framework agreements.
(14) The impact on the affected branch of the Community industry, particularly on those firms producing a large share of unbranded standard goods, was reflected above all in declining production and sales, loss of market share and a clear drop in prices, combined with considerable shrinking of net profits or increasing losses.
- increased sales of ACP commodities in the Eastern European states.
Mr CHEYSSON pointed out that there was a definite recession on the Community alcohol market, which was naturally affecting sales of rum in the same way as sales of other types of alcohol.
Their production and sales increased between 1981 and 1984 by 2%.

Higher car sales in 1994 led to a modest recovery in rubber industry production though it was still below its 1992 level in value terms.
This explains the 10% increase in sales by small enterprises in France from 1980 to 1989.
The volume of hard coke sales in the Community fell from its 1990 level of 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes. During this period, the drop for each country in percentage terms ranged from 3% for the United Kingdom to 17% for Luxembourg.
The volume of hard coke sales in the EU fell by 1.8 million tonnes (- 4.4%) from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.

The principal measures adopted in 1972 for disposing of surplus butter and skimmedmilk powder were continued. They included sales of butter at reduced prices to certain food processing industries and to certain categories of consumers.

(i) either the commissions usually paid or agreed to be paid or the additions usually made for profit and general ex penses (including the direct and indirect costs of marketing the goods in question) in connection with sales in the Community of imported goods of the same class or kind;
Tunisia's sales of manufactures are heavily concentrated in clothing and to a lesser extent textiles (over 18% of all exports in 1979), partly as a result of the spectacular rise of "outward processing" in response to investment by firms from the Community countries, especially Germany.
They may even lead, as already in northern products, to the Community displacing established exporters on world markets by subsidised sales.
Morocco in particular has succeeded in diversifying her sales from France and Germany to Benelux and Scandinavia and above all to the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
The merit of this would presumably be that it was less apparently committing than guarantees of income or sales on Community markets themselves.
Since in most of the cases mentioned, employment is at least as important as the payments effects, a better course would be to provide guaranteed sales in reduced quantities but at higher (potentially internal Community) prices than has been the case in the past.
129 minimum prices does not apply to the sales of books, newspapers or periodicals,or to goods and services which are subject to special legislation laying downminimum or fixed prices.

For minerals such as copper, phosphates and iron ore the ACP countries are given project assistance if production and sales are threatened and export earnings decline as a result.
Aggregateconcentration in the food manufacturing and processing industry (FMP), as measuredby FMP sales, is low.
Obviously this scheme is no patent recipe for Community agriculture. In individual cases, however, it can help to open up new sales possibilities and provide new sources of income.
None the less, with the crisis continuing, the accusation of protectionism is often made on both sides by pressure groups who have encountered obstacles to sales of their products or who are afraid of a diversion of exports from other producer countries, whose traditional outlets have been closed up.
The Netherlands' exports consist, to quite a large degree (just under 30% in 1983), of commodities and intermediate products, sales of which are particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions; they could be boosted by the current restocking process.
This would represent substantial additional sales, bearing in mind that, in mid1983, forecasts of sales abroad amounted to 440000 million m3.
It is probable that there will be little, if any, expansion in the demand for steel products, and this will probably be reflected in a fairly sluggish increase in total exports in spite of the buoyant growth of sales by new firms.
While export sales of natural gas were again down on the level of the previous year, manufactured exports were relatively buoyant in spite of the large appreciation of the guilder in 1986 and 1987.
Because ministries retained control over supply channels and prices, as well as guaranteed sales, most enterprise managements were more con cerned to maintain smooth bureaucratic relationships than to claim their new managerial freedoms.

Militants - boosted by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to target the pro-western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential compounds, government buildings and energy-sector installations.
However, inspectors have not so far disclosed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
A high-ranking western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
Furthermore, like a number of other critics of the project, he is afraid that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the facility. "We have to reckon with whole busloads arriving," said Schulz.
The new branch at St. -Peter-Strasse 17 was one of the biggest and most modern facilities in Europe . 
Choren USA has already been founded , and a government guarantee has been requested for the construction of a plant .

Trained and talented technicians and the use of state-of-the-art equipment , digital technology , well-equipped studios , animation and special effects facilities have not only made India an efficient production center , but also caught the fancy of Hollywood . 
China went on a wastewater treatment plant building spree between 2006 and 2012 , and the number of facilities more than tripled to 3,340 . 
That means a lot of the new facilities are n't even running at full tilt . 
China Everbright International ( CEI ) , which focuses on environmental projects , is the country 's dominant trash-handler right now , with facilities in coastal regions such as Guangdong , Shandong , Zhejiang and Jiangsu . 
The idea has yet to really take hold , but a cement treatment joint venture between Anhui Conch Cement and Kawasaki Heavy Industries at a facility in Tongling is making a small profit , say Credit Suisse analysts . 
BBMG Corp. , which makes cement and other building materials , runs two facilities in Beijing – one that treats sludge and another that treats industrial waste . 
Since 2004 , however , the renewed rise in oil prices and increased awareness of the climate problem have again prompted the planning and construction of solar plants in various parts of the world , including the south-western USA and North Africa as well as Spain . 
The partners intend to build major renewable energy installations . 
The Zurich Zoo has an excellent reputation far beyond the Swiss borders for creating animal-friendly facilities . 
The total cost of using cloud storage , for example , is 70 percent lower than keeping it in-house , with savings on everything from facilities to warranties and maintenance . 
Even though the country has reportedly had no serious atomic accidents , construction of new plants was halted for extraordinary inspections , and safety regulations were reviewed and tightened . 
Food security , access to sanitary facilities and health care all still represent major challenges . 
Factors such as construction style , insulation , windows , lighting , technical installations – all these offer a great potential to save energy and money , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . 
That 's why government-owned oil producer Statoil has been operating the Sleipner facility , off Norway 's west coast , since 1996 . 
The new " Snowwhite " facility in northern Norway has a capacity of 0.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide . 
Added to that , there are currently plans for a facility with a capacity of 2.5 million metric tons over the next decade . 
In southern Algeria , the oil producer operates a facility with a capacity of 1.2 million metric tons per year . 
Aging facilities are in need of repair , while growing populations also are straining existing system capacities . 
Aging facilities are in need of repair , while growing populations are also straining existing system capacities . 
The company has dedicated , specialized employees who are following the projects and developing new applications for the technology to meet the requirements for safe and efficient monitoring of the installations under construction . 
The facility , billed as a hot , high-end destination when it opened in Atlantic City in early 2012 , is losing money and recently requested a cash infusion from investors . 
The Bolivian side has also reported that they “anticipate the construction of sanitary facilities and storm sewers in the towns of Copacabana and Gauqui, plus a landfill in Desaguadero, to keep this waste from going into Titicaca”.
The plan for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is that they will use half of the park for a canoeing course and its facilities.
In this second video, we see the guide explaining how the area was in pre-Hispanic times, how ancient Peruvians used the facilities and how the area is been preserved nowadays:
In addition, electric utilities must operate heavy and aging installations, with which they are not entitled to make money by focusing only on the retail segment.
Yet only 5 percent of the facilities do so.

While that arrangement is being negotiated, States should, without surrendering the right under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to construct such facilities, voluntarily institute a time-limited moratorium on the construction of any further enrichment or reprocessing facilities, with a commitment to the moratorium matched by a guarantee of the supply of fissile materials by the current suppliers at market rates.
Scientific advancements in biotechnology and the ubiquity of facilities capable of producing biological agents circumscribe prospects for the elimination of biological weapons and complicate verification efforts.
While that arrangement is being negotiated, States should, without surrendering the right under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to construct uranium enrichment and reprocessing facilities, voluntarily institute a time-limited moratorium on the construction of any further such facilities, with a commitment to the moratorium matched by a guarantee of the supply of fissile materials by the current suppliers at market rates.

Among the difficulties faced in securing and deploying troops was the fact that when a mission was to be deployed in regions where adequate facilities and accommodations such as airports did not exist, countries would definitely not go, and that was why the Department could not comply with the deadline of 90 days for the deployment of an operation.
Demands that all Ivorian parties, including the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles, provide unhindered access, particularly to equipment, sites and installations referred to in paragraph 2 above, to UNOCI and French forces which support it to enable them to carry out the tasks set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 above;

"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices," said Bode.
No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs.
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading. According to the survey, one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation.
He called upon governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and investment practices that do not come at the expense of Southeast Asia 's natural resources – chiefly its forests . 
Some investors seem to be moving into safe haven investments such as gold . 
Instead , investors in Europe hold an average of 34 percent short-term investments , compared to 14 percent in the USA . 
Instead , short-term investments are more than twice as popular in Europe . 
For small countries in particular such as Switzerland , where the scale of the domestic capital market limits opportunities to diversify investments and select securities , investments in foreign securities play a considerable role . 
Over the past years the economy benefited strongly from global demand for US investments , particularly in the form of securitized debt , which financed a large current account deficit . 
Entire financial universe – investments and trading – has been catered for increasingly over the last 100 years ; Swiss offering is unmatched by almost any other financial market . 
Previously , investing in sustainability was mainly about screening out investments in " sin sectors " such as alcohol , arms or tobacco . 
Investments like these , plus equity holdings and cash reserves , constitute the asset side . 
What about the currency risk , should investments be hedged ? 
So in a broad-based comparison , we expect that  the risk return ratio of emerging market investments will further improve in the future . 
Investment guru Jim Rogers once said that  in order to invest in emerging markets , the best thing you can do is to buy what the emerging market economies are buying themselves , namely commodities . 
A New Era of Sustainable Investments 
Early approaches simplistically screened out investments in " sin sectors " such as alcohol , arms or tobacco . 
At Credit Suisse , we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that  environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) challenges can impact a company ’s capacity to generate long-term financial returns . 
Our research methodology for sustainable investment begins with an analysis of the sustainability risks and opportunities that can materially impact a company 's ability to sustain profitability . 
Why do sustainable investments and sustainably managed companies get so much more public attention now when compared to ten years ago ? 
Catastrophes like Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon caused investors to question what the impact is of their investments on the environment and communities . 
With the recent and current market turbulence , awareness of sustainable investments has also gained importance . 
Looking ahead , do you see the sustainable investment trend staying limited to niche pure plays such as clean tech , or do you see the integration of ESG criteria becoming an enduring trend in the global investment community ? 
We aim to provide investors with our expertise in sustainable investments ; play a visible , major and leading role in this field ; and benefit from the continuous growth in this area . 
" The quality of the investment and banking products , the quality of the advisory process , the quality of the tools we provide and , most importantly , the quality of our people , is key , " Pauli explains . 
" Returns are as important as ever , " acknowledges Pauli , " but appropriate advice is at least as important , including clear rationale for proposing an investment to a client or advising against it . " 
" Investing has become very complex , " says Pauli , " and beyond a certain point , product specialists are necessary to provide specific , detailed knowledge about an investment . " 
Asset Management specialists can help out with investments in funds and alternative investments ; investment bankers can be consulted on strategic decisions such as initial public offerings ( IPOs ) or mergers ; relationship managers from Private Banking can help to find the best ways to oversee personal assets . 
Value investing , for instance , goes as far back as Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their investment classic " Security Analysis " ( 1934 ) . 
In the words of John Maynard Keynes , contrarians believe that  a " central principle of investment is to go contrary to general opinion , on the grounds that  if everyone agreed about its merits , the investment is inevitably too dear and therefore unattractive . " 
On one hand , the renewed rise in risk aversion in view of the debt problems in Greece and Spain has triggered a flight to secure investments . 
On the other hand , from the perspective of non-Swiss investors , an investment in Swiss francs represents a diversification element in their portfolios . 
Another factor is the flow of funds into indexed products , which is being met with a relatively illiquid market . This forces investors of passively managed portfolios into investments at a yield level that is unsustainable in our view . 
The scale of the task was made clear when the Bank reported its third-quarter 2011 earnings – the new Basel III regulations would have more than doubled investment banking RWAs , with fixed income behind a great majority of the increase . 
The lack of investment alternatives and high level of liquidity in the safekeeping accounts of investors worldwide also support investment in equities . 
You make a decision ( you purchase an investment ) and hope for positive results ( you would like to see a return ) . 
It is a measure of the fluctuations in yield from an investment around its average . 
Investments with very low risk , such as the majority of money market instruments , are assigned a score of 1 , while very risky investments , like options , receive a 5 . 
This is especially important in view of the highly unusual market environment for fixed income investments at present , which is characterized by exceptionally low yields and a poor supply of safe investments . 
For investors who wish to participate in the potential offered by equity markets but who are not willing to bear all the associated risks , an investment in convertible bonds is one option . 
Many entrepreneurs who have established businesses are also looking to monetize part of the wealth locked up in their businesses and start diversifying into unhedged and uncorrelated investments . 
Long-term investment in Colombia 's oil , mining , manufacturing and transportation sectors is proving more stable than the equity and debt investments currently fleeing other emerging markets . 
New Opportunities in Responsible Investment 
In fact , the first comprehensive review of assets in seven regions across the world by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance ( GSIA ) conducted in 2013 reported that  at least USD 13.6 trillion of professionally-managed assets now incorporate Environmental , Social and Governance ( ESG ) considerations into investment selection and management . 
This comprises almost 22 percent of the funds under management in the regions surveyed , showing that  the sustainable investment industry has a significant scale in the global arena . 
The final panel discussion was on the crucial topic of ' Impact Investing ' , which concerns investments that generate social and/or environmental benefits alongside financial returns , as a result of sustainable company growth . 
Recalling the April 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh , which left more than 1,100 garment workers dead and at least another 1,000 seriously injured , Mr. Niedermaier said investors with a long-term perspective , such as sovereign wealth funds , ultra-high-net-worth individuals and pension funds , find this type of investment particularly appealing . 
Responsible Investment ( RI ) is an investment approach that incorporates Environmental , Social and Governance ( ESG ) considerations into investment selection and management . 
We have been raising money rapidly , especially in alternative investments , and now have to industrialize all the processes – from marketing to distribution . 
Speaking of growth in alternative investments , what is driving that demand ? 
I think AM with its strong alternative and traditional investment products , as well as its strong multi asset class solutions business , caters well to those needs . 
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process ? 
What does this mean in terms of investments ? 
Hand-picked by Credit Suisse 's Investment Strategy & Research team , the following seven investment ideas are designed to ensure you get the most out of your money in the second half of 2014 . 
Giles Keating , Head of Research , shares the rationale behind the ideas and the investment implications . 
" European clients , for instance , like to delegate their investments and often go for discretionary mandates . 
The third factor could play a role , even though we do not have explicit government requirements with regard to investments . 
Life insurance companies and pension funds , both of which traditionally rely strongly on fixed-income investments , are facing problems . 
In light of their risk profile and the investment guidelines ( BVG ) , it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share in riskier investments such as equities or high-yield bonds . 
The consequence of this deleveraging is that  market participants are liquidating their emerging market investments . 
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who constantly demand a return on their investment . 
The surge was sparked in 2001 by low supply , robust growth in employment , an expansionist monetary policy and a trend for many households to redirect investments away from stock markets into housing . 
Alongside conventional direct investments , there are a variety of indirect investment opportunities that eliminate potential disadvantages such as low liquidity and lack of transparency . 
Put simply , I determine whether we invest relatively more in bonds , equities , cash or alternative investments , also on the allocation of different sub asset classes , such as credits , hedge funds or private equity , regions , countries and styles , such as value or growth stocks . 
And now , there are a number of ways of drawing those kinds of trends together into single investments . 
I think that  will provide a very good background for many of these mega trend investment themes . 
In fact , an investment strategy of investing in countries that have shown weakness in economic growth has historically earned high returns . 
The key investment theme to invest in India would be consumption – be it consumer staples , personal products , electronic goods , discretionary goods like automobiles and mobile phones , or luxury goods . 
Each profile indicates the bandwidth for bonds , equities , alternative investments , and currencies . 
US figures provide a flavor of the return potential of farmland investments . 
and Hence , farmland investment would have been a valuable asset in most portfolios over the past two decades . 
It is the vintage that turns great wines into good investments . 
The report also provides valuable data for important top-down investment analysis and puts current market concerns about government indebtedness into context by showing that  the estimated 45 trillion dollars in global government debt in mid-2010 represents only one-fifth of the 195 trillion dollars in global household wealth , ” Giles Keating said . 
They will in turn provide secular investment opportunities for companies geared to these trends . 
Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund found that  out first-hand after one of his investments in a portfolio of more than 80 , most famously the internet voice and video calling software Skype , went bad in 2009 and drained every last penny . 
The effort has led to new structured products , customized investments and investment funds including a USD 750 million credit fund . 
It is important that  we can cover clients from pure wealth generation , providing integrated solutions for their company , to the stage where they require sophisticated asset management and investment services . " 
" Our biggest competition over the past couple of years has been passive investments , " says Küffer . 
The client was a shareholder in two companies and had monetized part of his investment through a flotation of both . 
" There have been cases where we ’ve provided M & A and capital markets advisory services to an international listed corporate , while at the same time providing personalized investment or financing advice to its family holding , " Fleuriot said . 
It is therefore fair to say that properly advised hedge fund investments are , generally speaking , not necessarily riskier than traditional investments . 
Alternative investments therefore remain a key part of any diversified asset allocation . 
Unlike in the 1990s the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved through practically risk-free investments such as Swiss federal bonds . 
However , the investment of the coupon and the repayment principal of the bond at higher rates of interest compensates for market value loss in the long term . 
But it is definitely not an appropriate mid- or long-term investment alternative in a cycle of negative real yields , as it would mean real losses for the investor . 
Swiss banks could tap into new and interesting business lines , by broadening the available products and services in the areas of philanthropy , microfinance , sustainable investments and impact investing . 
But against the backdrop of latent structural inflationary pressures that are difficult to predict , we are already turning our attention increasingly to real investments . 
Real investments constitute a cornerstone of our investment strategy . 
The economic headway that has been made , generous provision of liquidity by central banks , persistently attractive or fair valuation of riskier investments , coupled with ongoing pressure to invest , should get the financial markets pendulum swinging back again toward opportunities . 
As for alternative investments , the aim will once again be to achieve the right mix between these heterogeneous investments . 
In sharp contrast to the euro or dollar , risk-free investments in Swiss francs are still generating positive returns . 
This opens the door to a major reform of economic customs systems, on which, in fact, Parliament will be informed in detail in the next couple of months prior to approval.
In any event, Madam President, I believe that Biarritz has contributed something very positive, and that is the unanimous approval of the Charter.
The French Presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the Western Balkans which are close to being achieved: the development of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the adoption of the CARDS programme, the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences, to mention but the more noteworthy Community measures.
In this sphere, following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency made the adoption of the social agenda one of its priorities.
It would therefore be appropriate to set as the date of entry into force of the regulation the date of adoption of the implementing regulation, so as not to lose the appropriations available in 2001.

The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges.
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote," Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the MEI it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
Particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers," these powers supposedly expiring following adoption of the Constitution.
Approval of the initiative opposing mass immigration has made the situation more difficult . 
Tackling the aftermath of the financial crisis ; the shift in the global balance of power to emerging markets ; and the adoption of a major treaty within the EU . 
The low propensity to invest is due , to a small extent , to the approval of the initiative against mass immigration . 
What is clear , however , is that  the acceptance of the initiative has increased economic uncertainty in Switzerland with immediate effect . 
Just after the adoption of law a campaign against independent observers, youth activists, and politicians was unleashed.
Waking up to the news of #matrimoniogay approval makes me proud of living in a country that seeks equality.

Another danger that presents itself to the indigenous and traditional populations of Brazil is the possible approval of the new Forestry Code, presented by Communist politician Aldo Rebelo, in conjunction with the ruralist leader Katia Abreu, and that is being contested by environmentalists and activists from different areas.
During last year, the government and members of parliament have been the target of heavy criticism for their acceptance of the IMF memorandum and their inaction against the socio-economic crisis of the country, which has urged many of them to defend their beliefs and political actions.
It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
It is expected that the text will be submitted to the General Assembly for adoption during its millennium session, and Heads of State are invited to join the United Nations in celebrating the first ever convention against transnational organized crime at a special signing in December, hosted at Palermo by the Government of Italy.

Former staff regulation 1.6 dealt with this issue in one provision, which prohibited the acceptance of any benefits from a Government, and severely restricted the acceptance of benefits from non-governmental sources.
In proposing the language of staff regulation 1.2 (j), the Secretary-General believed that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to stress the importance of the appearance of strict independence and impartiality of staff and thus to reaffirm the absolute prohibition on acceptance of benefits from Governments.

- Results presented at the Seminar demonstrated that the assumption that operators of farms and their families are solely dependent on farming for their livelihoods and use all their resources on agriculture is no longer tenable.
Similarly, the common simplifying assumption that each holding has only one farmer and one household is clearly invalid in the context of measuring the income of households who are mainly dependent on farming for their livelihoods.

The slight decrease in capacity is due principally to the abandonment of a number of expansion and replacement projects.
The new measures adopted for wine concern the stepping up of both the scheme for the permanent abandonment of areas under vines and the dissuasive character of compulsory distillation.
At the same time it was decided that growers receiving the permanent abandonment premium would have their right to replant any remaining winegrowing areas curtailed by 40% in the case of category III vineyards (plains) and by 20% in the case of category II vineyards (hillsides).
By delaying the payment of premiums due under Articles 4 (6) and 8 (2) of Council Regulation No 456/80 on the granting of temporary and permanent abandonment premiums in respect of certain areas under vines and of premiums for the renunciation of replanting, Italy has failed to fulfil its obligations under that Regulation

The terms of reference of this study refer to the transfer of the "head office" of a company without dissolution.
The condition "without dissolution" shows that we are dealing with the private international law rules which determine the proper law of a company and whether a company can be recognised as a duly incorporated legal person.
This study is limited to the question whether, as a matter of company law and private international law, Member States rules should be harmonised so that a company can transfer its siège réel to another Member State without dissolution. In order to answer
(1) the proper law of a company; (2) the change of the proper law of a company; (3) the possibility of departure of the siège réel withou dissolution; and (4) the possibility of arrival of the siège réel with continuir, legal personality of the company.
This requires dissolution of the company in the state of departure and reincorporation in the state of arrival.
However, not all jurisdictions which apply the theory of the siège réel allow a company to transfer its siège réel to another country without dissolution.
In some Member States this would entail the dissolution of the company, namely in:
In all the Member States a company can move its siège réel within the jurisdiction without dissolution.
(1) It is desirable that a company be able to transfer its siège réel from one Member State to another without dissolution.
(2) By virtue of the freedom of establishment, a company is entitled to transfer its siège réel without dissolution (subject to measures taken by Member States justified for the protection of the general good).
This is a retrograde step for those Member States which apply the theory of the siège réel and allow the company to transfer its siège réel without dissolution.
The state of departure may close such register only upon proof of dissolution of the company in accordance with the laws of a Member State having jurisdiction.
This could be, e.g. laser sensors. They have a decent depth resolution, which is very important.

Adequate brightness, good contrast, non-flicker and non-reflecting screens coupled with high resolution and correct character size are important factors for legible display.
The greater the resolution of the screen, i.e. the more image points are available for each character, the more legible the information.
Graphics display screens normally have a greater resolution than screens used only for the display of letters and numbers.
The effective resolution and the quality of the image can be tested in practice by comparing two critical characters and establishing whether they can be easily confused or not. Character pairs which are easily confused are:

Other databases with a higher resolution can be used within the case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level, it should be highlighted the CORINE and CORINE-Phare Projects within the EEA, which is generating land-cover information for Europe using TM imagery, achieving high resolution and accuracy.
It does not contain, at this phase, remote sensing imagery at a full resolution, although some degraded samples are available.
The five basic attributes describing land cover (woody, herbaceous, bare soil, artefact, water) may be easily populated with earth observation data (both low and high resolution) on large areas for mapping purposes.
This option enables the execution a highquality base, with expected geometrical accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometrical resolution of 1m, any point can be located unambiguously, with the exception of objects with a resolution below 1 metre.
The rule of thumb given above must be reviewed if the image resolution is relatively coarse, i.e. if there is a considerable proportion of mixed pixels for the objects whose total area is being estimated.
On the other hand, our agrometeorological models and methods of monitoring the state of vegetation using medium-resolution satellite images still require further research and development.
Presently, the GEOSTAT GIS does not only contain raster and point data with a resolution of 1 ha but also several vector data sets.
Integration, administration and maintenance of different geocoded, spatially relevant data available with the Swiss federal administration. For this data, coverage of the entire country and a spatial resolution of 100 m, resp. a map scale of 1: 25000 are envisaged;
Once or even twice annually, data on the development of a reduced number of landuse categories (maybe 20 or less) at a lower area resolution and accuracy could be published to bridge the information gap of 12 years between each photo-based land use statistics.
Remote sensing provides data for geometric grids which vary with the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the programme of variables, the scale and geometric resolution (smallest differentiated spatial unit), the classification and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
In 1990, the first year of operations, a problem emerged with regard to the selection of sample fields: the relatively poor geometrical resolution of the images available at the time (Landsat TM: 30m χ 30m) made it practically impossible to identify very small fields.
Six of the seven spectral channels of the Landsat scenes taken in July 1990 and April and July 1991 were used in the calculations. The thermal channel was excluded from the calculation because its low resolution (120 m χ 120 m) caused too many mixed picture elements at the edges of the land parcels.
The planned improvement in the spectral resolution of Landsat 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller trial fields.
Satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 m χ 15 m) should be made available as soon as possible; at the same time it should be examined whether the inclusion of additional statistical and/or meteorological parameters in the correlation calculations can produce sufficiently high coefficients of determination and satisfactory confidence intervals for the estimation of yield.
In fact, starting from 1987 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, assisted by the ITA Consortium, has been carrying out estimates of crop areas and forecasts of crop yields using satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution, integrated with sampling data from land use surveys performed over 4500 areal segments measuring 50 and 100 hectares.
The first trial joint utilization with satellite data was carried out in 1981, using a Landsat MSS image. This trial did not produce convincing results, which was attributed to the inadequate resolution of the MSS sensor.
It also shows that the ground data collected by points can be used as well as the segments to operate the regression estimator, provided that the satellite has adequate resolution, SPOT appearing to be superior to Landsat TM for this type of application.
Finer spatial resolution is needed to investigate environmental effects.
- Applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy in the estimation of the geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites, in as little as thirty minutes, can survey areas as large as one-fifth of the world's surface and can provide imagery with 5 or 2.5 km resolution.
Some of the problems and difficulties encountered were mentioned. Among others, the difficulty of obtaining consistent multitemporal data; the difficulty of developing a consistent and agreed classification and the limitations of scale and resolution of other data sets with which the land cover data need to be combined.
PC with Pentium 100 Mhz processor (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM 4X reader (minimum) - 15 MB of free space on hard disk - Super screen VGA 256 colour (resolution 640 χ 480) - Windows 95

I will simply say that, this morning, act ing on my proposal, the Commission adopted an interest ing communication on this matter which, whilst of course pointing out the budget policy line, raises a number of possibilities that Europe could implement.
Germany had spared no efforts and made every sacrifice to achieve this, and you will understand, Mr President, if I extend this tribute to Chancellor Kohl who held this course with such courage and determination.
In this respect, this declaration is indeed aimed at all European institutions but its chief justification is as an internal discussion paper for Parliament. This is because it attempts to chart the most democratic course possible for Parliament to negotiate in 1999.
We are now altering the course of the Union, making for a more transparent and democratic people's Europe.
The bitcoin exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning today to around a dozen dollars (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
The rate of the Euro sank in the afternoon, ending at $1.1262.
According to the Credit Suisse Fair Value Model , the Swiss franc is still undervalued in relation to the euro , even though the franc-euro rate has risen from more than 1.60 to about 1.50 since 2007 . 
Shares from industrialized countries are valued at a price/earnings ratio ( PER ) of 17 , versus a figure of 10 for the emerging markets . 
Value investors focus on the " price " in the price/earnings ratio , whereas growth investors are more interested in the " earnings " part . 
Thus , contrarian investors select businesses which are underpriced and show negative price momentum . 
And finally , the euro-franc exchange rate is still an issue : 
The stronger and more frequently the price of a stock oscillates , the greater the range of fluctuation and the riskier the investment . 
" The Swiss National Bank 's decision to set the exchange rate at 1.20 played a crucial part in the company beginning to grow again quickly , " Melli recalls . 
If you look back over a long historic comparison , and you adjust the gold price for inflation , then I have to say that gold does not look cheap at current levels . 
At the corporate level , earnings and earnings momentum rise from trough levels , and valuation multiples ( such as the price to earnings ratio ) begin to expand in anticipation of stronger earnings growth . 
When Geithner complained about the price of the yuan at the 2010 Forum , he garnered notice from both the media and Chinese authorities . 
If a rapid appreciation of the Chinese currency is potentially dangerous to the global economy , why is the White House fixated on the price of the yuan ? 
" Although today 's price earning ratios ( P/ E) are close to those recorded in 2007 , we do not expect a big correction for the moment . 
Macroeconomic aspects and corporate profits will play a subordinate role , meaning we expect an expansion of price to earnings ratios in 2013 . 
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of only 0.6 percent in 2014 , a figure well short of the BoJ 's target of 2 percent , meaning the central bank may need to drive the price of the yen down even further to meet its inflation goal . 
The highest subsequent returns tend to be produced when dividend yields are high and price/earnings ratios ( P/ E) low . 
higher returns on equity , higher price/book valuations and higher payout ratios , " said Stefano Natella , Head of Global Equity Research at Credit Suisse 's Investment Banking division . 
higher price to book values ( P/BV ) . 
The price earnings to growth ratios for most of the large cap companies and virtually all of the smaller cap companies are still quite attractive relative to global emerging market norms . 
So strong was the franc that  the dollar rate fell from around 4.30 francs to just over 2 francs within the space of a few years . 
In addition , valuations on forward price earnings ratios appear attractive , with most companies trading at the lower end of their historical ranges . 
Ultimately , costs will rise more gradually for Swiss-based companies than for their competitors abroad , while the euro exchange rate will remain constant at around 1.20 Swiss francs . 
Basically , the idea behind convertible bonds is that  investors hold bonds in a company , and when the company stock goes below a certain price the bonds turn into equity . 
When the franc-euro exchange rate was 1.60 , margins were much higher than they are now at 1.22 . 
OBJECTIVES: To avoid short-term distortions of trade which would be caused in certain Member States by the difference between the market rate and the agricultural conversion rate or 'green' rate in ECU.
- for Member States whose currency has fallen in value against the exchange value of the ecu defined by its agricultural conversion rate, the granting of compensatory amounts on imports and the levying of compensatory amounts on exports (negative MCAs).
To this end, MCAs are no longer calculated on the basis of the gap between the green rate and the central rate but on the basis of the gap between the green rate and 'the central rate, adjusted by a correcting factor'.
If 100 000 persons received DM 4500, of which 50% i s met by the ESF, it would be necessary to earmark for this purpose an annual amount of DM 225 m, or 120 m ECU at a rate of 1: 1).
On 8.10.1990, Pound sterling entered the ERM with an ECU central rate of 0.696904 which is slightly deifferent from its previous notional one.
It is these outflows which have contributed to depressing the value of the yen below the rate which would other wise have been expected.
Whether temporary foreign exchange funds are pro vided or the exchange rate is supported up to a certain level, whatever is done, help will be needed from economic experts, but quickly and without lengthy and time-consuming analyses.
The second is the conversion rate actually used or 'green rate', which enables Community agricultural prices to be converted into national prices.
Because the new Euro exchange rate might be particularly unstable in the early stages, there may be large fluctuations in prices for agricultural products on the world market when they are converted into Euros.
Does the Commission consider that the principle of equality under company law, including Article 42 ofthe second EC company directive, has been met by the Danish government's compulsory purchase of private shareholders' Αshares in Teledanmark at the rate of 125 and their sale to Ameritech USA at 4700 has been respected?

2 In the case of Guiana, the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the aid amounts shall be that in force on the first day of the month in which the eligible products are landed.
Where the sums to be paid in the various currencies are defined by reference to another currency, the conversion shall be effected on the basis of the rate specified in the contract.
There was not in the case of the other currencies any gap between their green rate and the market rate (as modified by the correcting factor).4
The conversion rate to be applied for the foreign currency payment shall be that in force 30 days prior to the latest date fixed for the submission of tenders.
Financial schedules for Community support frameworks and amounts of Community aid shall be expressed in ecu at the rate fixed by this Decision.
The Community financial contribution shall be paid in ecus at the rate applying on the first working day of the month in which the application for reimbursement is submitted, as published in the Official Journal of tbe European Communities.
But, the Tax Law has introduced procedures relating to the deductibility of exchange differences arising from translation of foreign currency monetary items when the closing rate is different from the rate at which they were recorded during the period or presented in previous financial statements (art.
Revenues and expenses are converted at the rate existing on the date of the transaction; in practice, an average rate is usually used.
Where the transaction is to be settled at a contracted rate, that rate should be used.
This means specifically that foreign currency monetary items are translated at the closing rate unless a hedging rate is used in accordance with paragraph 48.
Consequently the results of the year are always stated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
In most cases, foreign currency receivables and/or liabilities were translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of their incorporation whereby unrealised profits at the balance sheet date were not considered while the relevant translation losses were recognised.
That rate shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts.'
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are valued at their historic value converted into ecus at the rate applying when they were purchased.
Land and buildings acquired after 1992 in Brussels and at sites where the Commission has offices and delegations are entered in the balance sheet at their purchase value, converted into ecus at the rate applying when they were purchased.
Buildings in Brussels purchased before 1981 have been entered using the ecu conversion rate for January 1981.
Cash investments and disposable assets are valued at their face value converted into ecus at the rate applying on 31 December.
The dollar/ecu rate used to draw up the annual budget estimates of the expenditure referred to in Article 4 for any given year shall be the average market rate over the first three months of the preceding year.
In these years there were substantial currency realignments: all the economies in the first group saw increases in their exchange rates, the French rate declined slightly, and all others fell markedly.
Between September 1992 and March 1995, the exchange rate for the peseta was adjusted four times within the EMS (17-9-92, 22-11-92, 13-5-93 and 6-3-95), with a total devaluation of 26% in two-and-a-half years.
On that date the euro also replaced the ECU at a rate of 1 to 1.
The exchange rate used is the one calculated at the end of the period.
Three aspects of producer prices are of particular importance; their development over time at the Community level (dealt with by an index, which enables the price for individual cereal types to be combined, in real terms), the way that prices have developed and differ in Member States (absolute prices in nominal market ECU) and the relationship between producer prices and institutional prices (for some selected Member States in nominal national currencies).
Table 6: Dollar rate against the ECU, the yen and the DM
The total of the quarterly data may differ from the annual data because updates are carried out only on annual data and because data are converted into ecus using two different conversion rates (annual average rate and quarterly average rate).

Meanwhile the Finnish mark, having strengthened between March and November 1995, subsequently saw a reversal in trend, the FMK / DM rate falling to 3.14 at end March 1996, very close to the level of a year earlier.

'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'

'I have tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'
'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
"The mystery, and to the devil with the Flemings!" he exclaimed at the full force of his lungs, twining like a serpent around his pillar.
The antique symbol of the serpent biting its tail is, above all, applicable to science.
It is the mode of expression of humanity which is totally renewed; it is human thought stripping off one form and donning another; it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that symbolical serpent which since the days of Adam has represented intelligence.
The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of a serpent.

The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM), which is administered by a Board of Directors consist ing of the members of the Committee of Governors of Central Banks and a member of the Commission, is reponsible mainly for the functioning of the European Monetary System that was set up in March 1979 to replace the ?Snake?.
The EMS exchange rate mechanism differs from that of the 'snake' insofar as the EMS has been approved by all the Member States (although the United King dom and Greece do not participate for the time being in the intervention mechanism) and is therefore, a Community mechanism.
The EMS exchange rate mechanism differs from that of the 'snake' insofar as the EMS has been approved by all the Member States (although the United Kingdom and Greece do not participate for the time being in the intervention mechanism).
This was the famous 'snake in the tunnel' mechanism.
The snake was the narrower band of fluctuation allowed in respect of intraCommunity exchanges whilst the tunnel was the wider band allowed in respect of exchanges against the Dollar.
In the interim, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to run the snake in the tunnel mechanism) continues to exist as the precursor to the new institution.
Entirely pro tected animals (in Oberosterreich, for example, most birds and snakes and all lizards and amphibians) may not be chased, captured, disturbed, killed, acquired in living or dead condition, damaged, sold, transported or given to another person.

snake) in relation to those operating between these currencies and the dollar (the tunnel).
This led to frequent and sharp fluctuations in exchange rates. There were entrances and exits from the exchange stability mechanism and the snake, originally designed as an agreement of Community scope, was reduced to a zone of monetary stability around the mark.
On 12 April 1972 the "snake in the tunnel" narrowed the fluctuation margins between the Community currencies to ± 2.25% (the snake) and those operating between these currencies and the dollar to ± 4.5% (the tunnel).
The Basle Agreement of 24 April 1972, which narrowed the margins of fluctuation between Community currencies to 2.25% (the 'snake') was still being applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark, and the margin of fluctuation between these currencies and the dollar was 4.5% (the 'tunnel').
The return of the French franc to the 'snake' and the reasonably satisfactory functioning of this currency scheme, as well as the establishment of a European unit of account, were evidence of this.
During 1975, negotiations were held with a view to associating the Swiss franc with the 'snake', a move which should contribute to greater exchange stability in Europe.
Repeated monetary difficulties were the logical consequence: the French franc was withdrawn from the snake, sterling and the lira depreciated heavily on international markets and the German mark was revalued in order to alleviate tensions within the snake.
As a result of adjustments within the snake, the German mark is revalued by 2% against the European unit of account.
Two exchange-rate realignments - both concerning Scandinavian currencies - took place within the snake.
These amounts were reduced when the 1978/79 prices were set, but they again increased as a result of fluctuations in the floating currencies and revaluation of the snake currencies.
In the initial stages of its operation and for a limited period of time member countries currently not participating in the snake may opt for somewhat wider margins around central rates.
We still do not know whether it can withstand the somersaults which wrecked the 'snake'.
The former were 'floating', whereas the latter were linked together in the 'snake' and varied only within a margin of fluctuation.
Under the European Monetary System, the EMUA ('snake' unit of account) is replaced by the ECU, which is at par with the EUA and therefore about 21% below the value of the EMUA.
However, first Ireland and the United Kingdom, and then Italy, left the 'snake'.
On the other hand, the European Council has scored a number of successes, including British 'renegotiation' in 1975, direct elections to the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the replace ment of the 'snake' by the European Monetary System (EMS).
This approach came to be known as the 'Snake-in-the-tunnel' - the Community currencies forming the Snake and the outer bands permitted by the International Monetary Fund being the tunnel.
The three applicants to the Community, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the Snake in May 1972, but being unable to endure the discipline were obliged to with draw within a couple of months.
By early 1974 Italy and France had also left the Snake, reducing it in effect to a small group of German-dominated currencies.
The 'snake in the tunnel' was thus born.
The width of the snake (2.25%) was thus half the width of the tunnel (4.5%).
In addition, it was agreed in principle that intervention aimed at keeping European currencies inside the snake would use European currencies, while intervention in dollars would only be allowed to prevent the snake from leaving the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a system of joint floating of the European currencies against the dollar, thus preserving the snake but letting it out of the tunnel.
In September 1974 Mr Fourcade, the French Minister for Finance, proposed a plan of 'concerted floating' of all the Community currencies, which aimed at tightening the coordination between the five currencies of the snake and the four currencies that independently floated.
He proposed to start from the snake as it existed, but to form around it a kind of'boa', wider and more pliable, which would include the European currencies outside the snake.
This envelope around the snake could have margins wider than the snake's, and allow for the possible exit and re-entry of currencies.
In December 1975 the Belgian Prime Minister Mr Leo Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals aimed at strengthening the snake, giving it a more Community-like character and broadening its action to cover the key elements of economic and monetary policy.
According to Mr Tindemans, a strengthening of the snake was also likely to facilitate the progressive return to more international monetary stability. The first stage would consist of creating throughout the world large zones of stability within which stable exchange rates would be maintained.
This target zone for floating currencies was to gradually evolve toward the snake as the weight of the latter would be gradually increased.
To some observers the European Monetary System may appear as little more than an expanded and rechristened snake.
Indeed, as in the snake, membership in the EMS is optional.
While France, Italy and Ireland chose to adhere to it side by side with former snake members (that is, Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), the United Kingdom decided in 1978 to stay free from the EMS exchange rate mechanism, which is its essential component.
The duties flowing from this adhesion are also very similar to those that existed in the snake. A currency cannot vary relative to another by more than 2.25% around their bilateral parity (for the Italian lira however this margin is 6% at present).
- The spread between those two ECU rates is the basis for calculating the divergence indicator, which is another novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
Long discussions took place over the question whether it would be defined in relation to the ECU or whether the system of the parity grid as it existed in the snake would still be used.
However, Member States whose currencies did not belong to the snake in December 1978 (which was the case for France, Ireland and Italy) were given the right to opt for wider margins of up to 6%.
(ii) Measures of domestic monetary policy: these include, among others, action bearing on interest rates, which can have a direct influence on capital flows and contribute to relaxing tensions, as experience with the snake repeatedly showed.
The divergence indicator mechanism has thus added two important new features to the snake mechanisms: there is for the first time an objective basis for triggering consultation between competent authorities; obviously this goes a step farther than to affirm the principle of consultation which in other respects would be left to the participants' initiative.
Entry into force of the Basle Agreement establishing the system for the narrowing of the margins of fluctuation between Community currencies: the snake (margins of 2.25%) in the tunnel (plus or minus 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish krone join the snake.
The Danish krone rejoins the snake.
The lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona become associate members of the snake.
The Swedish krona leaves the snake; 5% devaluation of both the Danish and the Norwegian krone against the EMUA.
The Norwegian krone leaves the snake.
Chapter II recalls those previous attempts, from the statement of a number of objectives in the Rome Treaty to the concerted floating of European currencies in the 'snake'.
Chapter III examines the substance of the EMS and its machinery (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ECU, credit mechanisms), explaining the new elements in these mechanisms compared with the snake, and analysing the conditions required in theory for their proper functioning.
In the initial stages of its operation and for a limited period of time member countries cur rently not participating in the snake may opt for somewhat wider margins around central rates.
Two areas of Community activity have so far remained outside the scope of application of the EUA: the operations of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which were expressed in EMUA, a unit of account based on the central rates of the snake currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used 'representative rates' whose equivalents in national currencies were fixed by decision of the Council.
The applicant countries also join the 'snake'.
The pound sterling and the Irish pound leave the 'snake'.
The footprints of a wolf and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive, and were left behind after they trod in clay before it was burnt.

According to Prinz /15/ cohesive soils always consist of a mixture of clay and silt, with very different proportions of the larger grain sizes.
Under the same climatic conditions the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in silt or loam.
In particular clay, but also loam, are used as natural materials in dumps with predominantly static compaction at the base.
The use of such clay/sand mixtures is extremely economical and surveillance is simple.
The secondary (clay) liner in Variant 2 consists entirely of soil.
It is recommended that this layer should be made of materials that are compacted subsequently (usually clay) rather than from existing soils compacted in situ.
To calculate the thickness of the layer of clay, certain procedures are recommended by the EPA.
-9 requirements (60 cm compacted clay with a kf value of 1 χ 10 m/s) are no longer sufficient.
In the thin wall process, depending on the specific geological characteristics, the subsoil is compacted by filling it up or adding sealing materials (clay/cement and bentonite/cement mixtures).
The gradient i in the area of the wall is calculated from the difference in water levels and the thickness of the wall, while the gradient i for the liner base (clay, silt) is determined from the difference in water levels and the embedded depth of the trough wall.
The clay acts here like a semi-permeable membrane.
The anion exchange capacity is, however, increased by the organic substance kerogen, which is found finely distributed in clay up to 2% by weight.

Clay, that very plastic substance for which our ancestors had a wide range of uses and which is nowadays used in areas as diverse as building and the pharmaceutical industry, has physical and chemical properties that have attracted the notice of the scientists and technicians responsible for developing a safe and reliable system of disposing of nuclear waste by burying it deep into the ground.
The chief chemical component of clay is a silicate of alumina, a refractory material, so clay is not a good conductor of heat.
Figure 3: Clay and schist formations likely to be suitable for the disposal of conditioned highlevel waste in the Community Member States (1980) and some locations where in situ studies in clay are in progress.
The target formation, the so-called Boom clay, is found in the underground of the site and its thickness is more than 100 metres. The depth of it is such that a repository might be built at more than 200 metres below ground level.
The Boom clay displays some very attractive particularities such as a lithologie homogeneity, a very low permeability and an excellent retention capability.
Beneath the Boom clay, a sequence of alternating sands and clays is observed.
At the Mol site and its immediate surroundings, the sand layers below the Boom clay are not used for pumping of groundwater due to its relatively high solutes content and to its low yielding rate.

"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door,"" Roseanna Monk said.
On the Right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers," and on the Left by Michel Rocard explaining in 1990 that France "cannot accommodate all the world's misery."
